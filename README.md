# ppdb
Working with the paraphrase database for dataset expansion

Currently this repository is under development

To run this you must first install and place the ppdb-2.0-xxxl-all from [The Paraphrase Database website](http://paraphrase.org/#/download)

The working code is in daskTest.ipynb. Run all cells to create a folder of csv files that can then be used for parsing
